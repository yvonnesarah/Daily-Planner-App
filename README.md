# Daily-Planner-App

## ðŸ“Œ Description
The Daily Planner App is a simple, browser-based calendar application designed to help users organize their daily schedules. It allows users to add events for each hour between 9 AM and 5 PM, and saves them locally in the browser's localStorage for persistence across sessions. The app uses dynamic HTML and CSS, powered by jQuery, to provide a smooth user experience.

The app displays a calendar for the current day, with each time block color-coded based on whether itâ€™s in the past, present, or future. The past hours are highlighted in green (#75FF33), the present hour in red (#ff6961), and the future hours in yellow (#FFBD33).
